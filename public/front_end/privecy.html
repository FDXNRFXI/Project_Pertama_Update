SSL certificates are non-refundable. The value of any AdWords credit or other third-party add-ons is non-refundable. See domain registration agreement for more information.</p>
                        <p>Violations of HostCox's Terms of Service, Acceptable Use Policy, or Spam Policy may, at HostCox's discretion, result in immediate and permanent disablement without refund.</p>
                        <p>Disputed charges ("chargebacks") associated with any HostCox account may, at HostCox's discretion, result in immediate and permanent disablement.</p>
                        <p>HostCox will use commercially reasonable efforts to make DreamObjects available 99.9% of the time during each monthly billing cycle. If HostCox is unable to meet this service level, you will be eligible to receive a credit to apply to future DreamObjects billing cycles based upon the Unavailability for that month.</p>
                        <p>For the purposes of this agreement, Unavailability means that either (a) the DreamObjects service is unresponsive, or (b) DreamObjects returns a server error response to valid user requests for more than 60 seconds of consecutive requests.</p>
                        <p>Unavailability that is a result of scheduled maintenance is excluded from these conditions and will not be considered for service credit calculations. Scheduled maintenance is defined as maintenance that is announced at least 5 days in advance, and does not exceed one hour in any month.</p>
                        <p>Service credits will be calculated as a percentage of the bill for the billing cycle that the Unavailability occurred. The percentage for the credit will be calculated by dividing the number of minutes of Unavailability by the total number of minutes in that billing cycle.</p>
                        <p>Service credits must be claimed within 14 days of the Unavailability occurring by submitting a support ticket. Include as much detail as required to document the Unavailability.</p>

                        <p>Bandwidth pricing and measurement frequency is subject to change at HostCox's discretion. Customers affected by such changes will be notified no less than thirty (30) days in advance by HostCox Web Hosting.</p>

                        <p>Customer agrees that dedicated server payments are NONREFUNDABLE. For example, if Customer submits payment for twelve (12) months of service, service will be provided for twelve (12) months and will not be refunded if Customer chooses to discontinue service with HostCox mid-way through the term. DreamCompute services will be billed on a monthly basis; existing DreamCompute customers may remain on a pre-paid billing plan, but new customer accounts will be subject to a usage-billing plan. Termination or upgrades of DreamCompute services will result in the following refund and billing procedures:<br>Pre-Paid Billing DreamCompute Plan: Any termination or upgrade will result in a refund of the prorated value of the plan for the last billing period.</p>
                        <p>Usage-Billing DreamCompute Plan: Any termination will result in the customer being billed for usage, rounded up to the nearest hour.</p>

                        <p>HostCox reserves the right to alter the dedicated server packages advertised on its website at its discretion.
